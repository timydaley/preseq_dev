preseq beta release 0.0.3 (Aug 5, 2013)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Notable changes in preseq software:

  * Prediction of the complexity curve is done using the observed data
    when possible.  Previous versions bootstrapped the histogram and
    used the median estimate.  Bootstrapping is only done to compute
    confidence intervals.

  * Addition of quick mode option with flag -Q.  The complexity is 
    predicted with the observed data and bootstrapping is not done,
    speeding up the computation time tremendously.

  * Fixed a bug associated with the unistd.h header for GCC versions
    4.7+.  

  * Extensively updated the manual with examples and FAQ
